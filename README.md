# Type-Instructor
A basic type instructor program, has support for the entire alpha block of a keyboard, with more support to come.

Prompter: The main prompter that, when run, will give an introduction to the program and run through all of the learning sections. Contextual menu to be added at some point.

Alphas: Walks through learning the alpha block of the keyboard, reads from alphaPrompt.txt to prompt the person for their input.

AlphaPrompt.txt: The prompt and exercises that are scanned into the prompter that gives the program the ability to have the exercises dynamically changed if necessary.
